    label propagation
    
    Given two labeled masks, which contain similar segmentations, but one at timepoints t, 
    and one at timepoint t+1, the goal of this function is to make the labeling consistent 
    between the masks of the two timepoints.

    The function will take as input two labeled masks, mask_t and mask_tplus1, go over 
    each of the labels within mask_t, select the corresponding pixels in mask_tplus1, 
    and determine which label is most often found in those pixels of mask_tplus1.
    
    Note 1: this strategy might lead to lineages ending in 0, leaving that object untracked
    in all subsequent frames.
    
    Note 2: a more sophisticated approach would be to calculate an overlap matrix ij between
    labels i from mask_t and labels j from mask_tplus1, but this would be more computationally
    expensive, and the result would be the same. (The advantage of that would be to more 
    easily identify problem cases with multiple overlaps.)
